# T_Shaped_QD_HF
Calculates the Green's function and Transport properties of a T-Shaped Quantum Dot system attached to leads.


Uses a self-consisten approach to calculate the Green's functions in the Hatree-Fock approximation. Once the Green's function is calculated the thermoelectric transport properties are calculated within linear response theory.
